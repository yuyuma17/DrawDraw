DrawDraw is a great app for you to practice completing an amazing painting.

There are three kinds of painting brushes, several painting colors for you to choose, and you can also adjust the width and the opacity casually.

If you draw something wrong, you can press undo, redo, or clear to alter the lines of the painting.

DrawDraw also allows you to share the amazing painting with your friends, or save it as a screenshot.

If you have any other questions, please don't hesitate to let me know. Thank you!
